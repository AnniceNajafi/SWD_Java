 * Description: Your grandmother has put together a Thanksgiving spread with copious amounts of turkey, pumpkin pie,
 * mashed potatoes, gravy, stuffing, cranberries, and casserole. The food is almost unlimited, but unfortunately the
 * volume of your stomach is not. Naturally, as an engineering student, you want to optimize the usage of your
 * stomach space. Each unit of food has a volume (v), and enjoyment (e). The goal is to maximize your total enjoyment
 * such that the total volume of food youâ€™ve eaten is less than or equal to C, your stomach capacity. For each of the
 * foods listed above, define an object representing one unit of the food, with volume and enjoyment as attributes.
 * Write an algorithm that takes as input (f, C) where f is a list of food unit objects and C is the capacity of your stomach.
 * The volume and enjoyment of each food unit, as well as stomach capacity, should be entered by the user.
 * The program output should be an optimal enjoyment E based on the values entered, as well as the quantity of each food item
 * you should consume in order to attain optimal enjoyment.
